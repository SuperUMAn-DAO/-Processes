## Compensation Withholding Process
The following are the steps that will be taken to implement SUDAO-IP-9 [Stables Compensation Withholding due to Inactivity]

## Steps
- The operations team will do a check-up on all members of the DAO that receive stables compensation at the beginning of each month. They will use **Discord**, **Dework**, check the `**Out of Office**` discord channel,  and confer with team leads to confirm whether any member should be considered inactive.
- Within the first 1-4 days a call will be setup by operations team to create the inactive lists to present to team leads. Then give the team leads  3 days to go over the list before putting up the proposal to the DAO.

- If any member is deemed inactive they will be placed on an inactive list and contacted via DMâ€™s to be made aware. This will give them a chance to show proof of work done for the DAO during that month in the `**inactive thread`.** They will also be provided a link to that thread.

- The `**inactive thread**` will be within the `**SuperUMAn Lair**` channel on discord. It will contain the list of inactive members and be open for 5 days.

- Similar to the `**Alumni Promotions**` each member will need **8 SuperUMAns**, **4 of which are UMAsters**, to react to their name if they believe that that individual should be taken off the inactive list.
- If they fail to be taken off the list after **5 days**, they will be added to the next snapshot distribution proposal, the proposal that distributes the stables compensation for that month, as `**inactive members**`. This will also include their compensation tier level. That proposal will not have these members on the payout list for that distribution. Effectively distributing funds and preventing `**inactive**` members from getting compensated.

- This will not change the tier of the individual as that will be decided during the **alumni promotions**.

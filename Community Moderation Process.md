**Mission Statement**

The core mission of the SuperUMAns is to communicate the true power of universal access to markets and its benefits to the world. 

**Vision**

“Attaining universal access to markets is almost like learning a language. And it's up to us to figure out how to say beautiful things with it.”

From the SuperUMAn DAO DESIGN PRINCIPLES

## Who can  be a Community Moderator

- They have to be Core SuperUMAns and UMAsters
- They should also have roles directly involved with the people ( for example’ Onboarders role, Operations masters role and Team lead)
- Must have been a [Core] SuperUMAn or higher for 2 Epochs or more (including pre-DAO epochs)

## Criteria for being a Community Moderator

- They must have great knowledge of the SuperUMAn culture
- Emotional Intelligence; must be aware that emotions of people are involved when settling disputes, must know how to control one’s emotion when handling a case.
- Must emulate the core values of the DAO.


## Do we need a Community Moderator’s  channel
“Yes we do”
Some matters are meant to be discussed and handled privately

NB; The DAO is meant to know how matters are handled so what we can do while handling a dispute is to give the DAO the cause of the argument and why it was handled that way. 
(Agreed, we can allow members to see what's going on (read-only permissioned channel) while the write perm be given to Comm Mods only?)

## Number of Community Moderators
3-7 (2 each for NA/SA, Euro/African/Middle East, APAC time zones +1)
 

## Process of electing a Community Moderator
- You can only be nominated if having passed the criterias for being a Community Moderator

- Candidates can self-nominate or be nominated by Team Leads, UMAsters, Core SuperUMAns. This process will last for 5 days.
- Each candidate will give a brief statement on why they would like to be a mod and any experience they have.
- Operations masters compile the names of eligible nominees and their statements and set up an emoji reaction poll, which will last for 24 hours.
- Give the DAO a chance to vote (the vote needs to include 7 UMAsters and 3 Core SUs).
- If we have more than the max number of eligible candidates there will be an extra poll where the candidates with the highest number of votes are chosen. Please note that this poll will only be open to UMAsters and Core SuperUMAns.
- Elections will occur when a Community Moderator steps down or is removed.


## Process of settling disputes

- Calming the situation and studying the issue on-ground and reminding publicly of the values of the DAO
- Give appropriate analysis on what happened on the Community Moderator’s channel
- Discussions
- If it has to do with talking to the people involved; reach out to them privately (note; only after discussions can one be selected and asked to reach out to them)
- Gather their reasons and further the discussions on the Community Moderation channel
- Come up with possible solutions 
- And relay it to the DAO

## Process of off boarding due to negative behavior 

- Collate testimonials from other Community Moderators and Team leads (depending on how difficult the situation is)
- See if from the testimonials the negative behavior is persistent
- Further discussion
- Possible solutions

## Moderator Handbook
This document is meant to be a guideline for moderators of the SuperUMAn DAO Discord community. Please treat this as a living, breathing handbook that community mods can use to maintain the environment we’ve worked so hard to create.

- Use channels as they are intended. Be respectful of workspaces and keep fun content in fun spaces.

- Be helpful and be patient. If you know your way around the server, help others find their way. 

- Assume positive intent. Most people are trying to be helpful and while they may have trouble expressing their ideas, their intention is good. Try to react as if this is the case.

- Use the DAO Design Principles as a guide if you are unsure of what action to take. Ask yourself - does the action align with our Mission, Goals, and Values?

## Single-Person Incidents
If a member makes a post that does not align with community guidelines, the DAO Design Principles, or is intended to harm another member, the member may be muted and the message deleted before the active offboarding process is started.

If the member continues to cause issues/disruption, the moderators may give a formal warning. If the member has received two warnings, the moderators may mute the member for 24 hours. If the member has been muted more than once, the moderators may mute the member and invoke the active offboarding process.

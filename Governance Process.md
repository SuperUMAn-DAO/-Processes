## Governance Process
## Details of the SuperUMAn DAO Governance Mechanism
The governance mechanism is comprised of a four step process, involving [Discord](https://discord.gg/D9DxH6KtTR), [Discourse](https://discourse.superumans.xyz/) and [Snapshot](https://snapshot.org/#/superumans.eth). These will be linked together with Discord providing access to Discourse governance forums to identify the membership tiers which will be reflected in Discord roles in order that the members meeting the quorum requirement can be identified. The minimum amount of time it would take for a proposal to be passed is 8 days.
## Stage 1 - Optional Tempcheck

There will be a recommended temp check on Discord, general support, feedback suggestions, collaboration on proposal.

## Stage 2 - Compulsory Signal

A rough proposal will be posted on [Discourse](https://discourse.superumans.xyz/), to gather feedback including likes. If the post receives `5 likes`, it can then pass to the formal proposal stage. If the proposal has not received `5 likes` after `7 days` then the topic will be closed. Anyone can make a proposal. Proposals will be announced on the Discord announcement channel.

## Stage 3 - Formal Proposal and poll

A formal proposal on [Discourse](https://discourse.superumans.xyz/) can be submitted once the rough proposal in the above stage has received `5 likes`. The proposal may be slightly altered, however it should be transparently in the same spirit. This proposal will include a poll with three elements

**- Yes**

**- More Discussion**

**- No**

In order for a proposal to pass to a [Snapshot vote](https://snapshot.org/#/superumans.eth) a simple majority (51% of votes cast) is required for `Yes`. In order for this vote to be valid there is a quorum of `10%` SuperUMAns and `3` UMAsters, with the poll running for `5-7 days`. Formal proposals will be announced on the Discord announcements channel

## Stage 4 - Snapshot vote

If there is more than `51%` for `yes` in the poll in the stage above, the proposal then moves to a [Snapshot vote](https://snapshot.org/#/superumans.eth), comprised of a crisp summary of the proposal with link(s) to discussion on [Discourse](https://discourse.superumans.xyz/). This snapshot vote requires a `51% majority` and a `quorum` of `50%` of total DAO voting power. The snapshot will be open for `3-7 days`.
